# Portfolio (3D)

## GoldenEye: Source

<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dXj1w9cmtM" width="560"></iframe>

I spent 6 years as a lead developer for the fan GoldenEye 007 recreation project GoldenEye: Source under the pseduonym _jonathonssl_. During this time, I did mostly technical art, moving assets through the Souce engine's obtuse asset pipeline. I rigged the female scientist character (complete with a physics-enabled ponytail), produced many particle effects, and made the entire 3rd person character animation set. I spent several years working on and off on a remake of the _Basement_ level, in the embedded video above.

_Tools: Source SDK, SoftImage XSI, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects_

## Anvil
